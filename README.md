How are you today?






*When the first light comes inside my curtain I think of you. There will be another 15 hours till the same sunlight shine on you, but at this time I am more than willing to welcome it. I shall wait till it wakes you up and kisses you for me. I am too sleepy to open my eyes, only enough strength or consciousness to reach out to my phone to check your messages. I always hope you had left me words from yesterday, words of any meanings, whatever, anything.

*It’s been weeks. It’s only been two weeks but I am already impressed by proving myself that perhaps I am capable of falling in love, more than affording a crush. Thanks to the music you recommended I dreamed of him once more, in which he finally appeared in a solid figure instead of a feeling. I saw his sweater and the familiar school uniform, which I used to hug and lean my head and body on; and I have already forgotten what did that feel like. I have also forgotten his visage. Nothing, no nothing was remaining. The way I sensed was more according to an inner intuition instead of true memories. In the dream he spoke to me quite normally but I quickly packed and walked straight away. I don’t even know why I did that. I never will. I had been keeping building fantasies on fantasies after all, never could I be back to that point of time. During this life we will never talk to each other ever again, or at least I hope so. I have forgotten so many, even the lyrics we used to sing together, even my own vows, even his touch on my naked body. I forced myself to, consciously or unconsciously. I had to. Same is the way I forced myself to go after the crush and kept building it, though in heart I knew this will fade to nothingness within the time ahead. I may or may not be ready to allow all the sensitivity and love growing inside me again. After all I was nothing more than an once-abandoned young woman, screwed and hurt such that couldn’t even believe. Here, another point that I know you won’t like. And that was just me.

*But for now I only want to be your little princess. I waited for you as I waited for the earth to go around. Time flies with different speeds when I think of you and when I don’t. You are my intangible motivation. For life and for studies, for playing out and for staying late, for everything romantic in real life or only in my imagination. I am aware of the fact that I don’t even know you, but that doesn’t conflict with the idea that we may walk shoulder by shoulder in future. My fantasy has been so sweet that it wakes me up, but even faced that I prefer to go towards it.

*Not all love stories are epic novels. Some are short paragraphs. But that doesn’t make them less filled of love. Now I am alone, waiting for all these to fade in oblivion. Gently, peacefully, I wait.
