title: About me
<div class="blurb">
This cute girl originally comes from Nanjing, China
And has lived in Singapore, Paris and Ann Arbor
She has been to different places across Europe, APAC and the Americas
But her favourite city is Stockholm in Sweden
She speaks Chinese, English, French and Spanish
She loves language, music, hand-drip coffee, latte art, backery and cocktail making
Partly because she has always had a feeling for sciences and once pursued her journey in chemistry
Background in business and devoted in data
Moving forward to a bigger world and find minds different and alike
<p> She is 21 and will always be </p>
